# Module 5: Tell Your Story üìñ  
> *"Every map tells a story. Make yours compelling."*  

üìù **Tip:** Use the companion [`worksheet.md`](./worksheet.md) or [`worksheet.docx`](./worksheet.docx) as you build your story.

## üöÄ Welcome to Tell Your Story!

You‚Äôve created maps ‚Äî now let‚Äôs give them voice. In this module, you‚Äôll use **ArcGIS StoryMaps** to weave maps, media, and narrative into stories that move people.

---

## üéØ Learning Goals

By the end, you‚Äôll be able to:

- Craft narrative structure around spatial questions  
- Combine maps, text, images, and media in StoryMaps  
- Embed and configure your maps in stories (swipe, sidecar, express maps)  
- Design with readability, accessibility, and audience in mind  
- Publish and share with purpose  
- Iterate from feedback  

‚úÖ *You‚Äôve ‚Äúwon‚Äù when you have a published story that guides a reader through your spatial question.*

## ‚è±Ô∏è Warm-Up: Story Sketch (10 min)

- Pick a topic you care about (local issue, change over time, resource access)  
- Sketch a 3‚Äì5 frame storyboard: *Introduction* ‚Üí *Map insight(s)* ‚Üí *Conclusion / ask*  
- List possible media: photos, videos, charts

## üé¨ Interactive Practice: Build Your StoryMap

### Step A: Start Your Story

- Log into ArcGIS StoryMaps  
- Create a new story (blank or choose a template)  
- Add a **Cover Page** with title, subtitle, image or placeholder map  

### Step B: Add Narrative + Media

- Use **Text**, **Heading**, **Quote** blocks  
- Insert **Image** or **Video** blocks  
- Use **Immersive** blocks (sidecar, slideshow, map tour) for rich storytelling  
- Use **Express Maps** for quick map embed inline  

### Step C: Embed Your Map(s)

- Insert the map you made in Module 4  
- Configure its display (size, pop-ups, extents)  
- Use **Swipe** block to compare two maps side-by-side  
  - See [Swipe tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4afb9aefc2ff43fd81db3f74ddbf05d0)(https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4afb9aefc2ff43fd81db3f74ddbf05d0?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
  - Also read ‚ÄúSwipe right for a powerful storytelling tool‚Äù [blog](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-storymaps/constituent-engagement/swipe-right-for-powerful-storytelling?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Use **Sidecar / Slideshow** blocks to sync narrative with maps or visuals  

### Step D: Design & Accessibility

- Pick a **theme** that matches your tone  
- Turn on **navigation** or guided flow  
- Add **alt text** for images, ensure contrast and readable fonts  
- Preview the story as a reader  

### Step E: Publish & Share

- Choose sharing settings (Organization / Public)  
- Copy link & share with peers  
- Collect feedback and revise

## üìù Reflection & Feedback

1. Which StoryMaps block (swipe, sidecar, express) felt most powerful, and why?  
2. Did your narrative change as you built the map blocks?  
3. If someone skimmed your story for 2 minutes, what must they take away?  
4. What media or layout would you tweak next?  
5. How would you pitch this story to others (classmates, community, social media)?

---

## üéâ You Did It!

You turned raw maps into a flow‚Äîa story people can *walk through*. That‚Äôs how your spatial work becomes communication, insight, and action.

---

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Next?

In **Module 6: Next Steps**, we‚Äôll:

- Build your GIS portfolio (stories + maps)  
- Explore career & advanced tool paths  
- Plan community or 4-H projects with spatial storytelling  
- Scale your stories (websites, events, contests)

Would you like me to put this into a ready `.md` file and also insert placeholders for YouTube video demos (e.g. ‚ÄúWatch how this works‚Äù) so you can drop them in later?
