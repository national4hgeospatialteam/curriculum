# Module 2: Map Like a Pro 🗺️

> *"A good map tells a story. A great map makes you want to explore."*

## 🚀 Welcome to Map Like a Pro!

Now that you understand what GIS is, let's dive into the art and science of cartography - the craft of making maps! In this module, you'll learn how to read, evaluate, and create maps like a professional cartographer.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- **Understand** basic cartographic principles and design elements
- **Evaluate** map quality and effectiveness
- **Apply** design principles to map creation
- **Read** and interpret different types of maps

## ⏱️ Warm-Up Activity

**Map Detective Challenge:** Look at a map (any map!) and identify:
- What type of map is it?
- What story is it trying to tell?
- Who is the intended audience?
- What design choices were made?

*Take 5 minutes to examine a map and write down your observations.*
