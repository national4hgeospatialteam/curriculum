# Module 3: Spatial Thinking 🧠

> *"Spatial thinking is the foundation of understanding our world."*

## 🚀 Welcome to Spatial Thinking!

Now that you understand maps and GIS, let's develop your spatial reasoning skills! Spatial thinking is the ability to understand and work with spatial relationships - it's how we navigate the world, solve problems, and make sense of complex information.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- **Develop** spatial reasoning abilities
- **Recognize** spatial patterns and relationships
- **Understand** scale and distance concepts
- **Apply** spatial thinking to problem-solving

## ⏱️ Warm-Up Activity

**Spatial Puzzle:** Without looking at a map, try to draw your route from home to school. Include:
- Major landmarks you pass
- Approximate distances
- Direction changes
- Time estimates

*Take 10 minutes to sketch your mental map.*
