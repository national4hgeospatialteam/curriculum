# Module 1: What is GIS? 🗺️  
> *"The world isn't just what we see. It's what we map, analyze, and reimagine."*

---

## 🌎 Let’s Get YOU Started!

Have you ever wondered how your phone knows exactly where you are? Or how scientists track climate change across the globe? Or how activists expose environmental racism using neighborhood-level maps?

That’s GIS — **Geographic Information Systems** — a real-world superpower that helps us make sense of location, patterns, and decisions. 

Even if you've never directly used GIS, it powers the invisible relationships between geography, data and information that impact your life. From how Amazon gets your package delivered the same day to getting food to your grocery store or the roads that you drive on.. all of that is powered by **G**eographic **I**nformation **S**ystems.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- **Define** what GIS is in your own words  
- **Identify** real-world applications of GIS technology  
- **Explore** GIS careers and opportunities  
- **Connect** GIS to your own interests and community

## ⏱️ 60-Second Definition Challenge

Set a timer for 1 minute.

**Prompt:** *“What is GIS?”*  
→ Jot, sketch, or voice-record your thoughts. It’s okay to guess — just activate your brain!

## 🧠 What is GIS?

GIS = **Geographic Information System**.

It's a digital system that helps us:
- **Collect** spatial data  
- **Store** and organize it  
- **Analyze** patterns and relationships  
- **Visualize** the insights using maps and tools  
- **Communicate** those stories to others

> 💡 *It turns invisible systems into visible stories.*

| 💻 **Software Tools** | Programs like ArcGIS, QGIS, Felt |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **People** | *You*, using data to make change |

## 🧪 Interactive Practice: Map Explorer Lab

### 🌍 Tool: *ArcGIS Online People Map* (link coming soon)

**Try this:**

1. Click into the map viewer  
2. Turn on 2–3 layers  
3. Zoom into your area or one that interests you  
4. Ask: *What do I notice? What questions come up?*

**Look For:**
- Any surprising patterns?  
- Who's included or excluded?  
- How might this map influence decisions?

🎯 *Optional Bonus:* Explore the [ArcGIS Living Atlas](https://www.livingatlas.arcgis.com) and see what data or information that interests you!

## 🌍 Real-World Uses of GIS

| Sector | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| 🏥 **Healthcare** | Map COVID trends, ambulance routes, health deserts |
| 🌱 **Environment** | Track deforestation, water pollution, fire risk |
| 🏙️ **Urban Planning** | Improve transit, housing access, or food systems |
| 🛒 **Business** | Choose locations, study customer patterns |
| 🧭 **Social Justice** | Map inequities in policing, parks, or public funding |

> “Maps don’t just reflect power — they can *challenge* it.”

## 💼 GIS Careers: What Can You Do?

Some common careers with GIS as a main focus include:
- **GIS Analyst** or **Cartographer**  
- **Researcher and scientists**  
- **Civil or environmental engineer**  
- **App developer** (map-based apps)  
- **Planner and designers** 
- **Consultant**

However, keep in mind that GIS is simply a skillset that will be valuable no matter what career you go into. From the humanities to business to medicine, everything if it happens in place- it connects to GIS.
