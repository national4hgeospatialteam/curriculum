# Module 1: What is GIS? 🗺️  
> *"The world isn't just what we see. It's what we map, analyze, and reimagine."*

---

## 🌎 Let’s Get YOU Started!

Have you ever wondered how your phone knows exactly where you are? Or how scientists track climate change across the globe? Or how activists expose environmental racism using neighborhood-level maps?

That’s GIS — **Geographic Information Systems** — a real-world superpower that helps us make sense of location, patterns, and decisions.

GIS isn’t just about maps. It’s about asking better questions, telling deeper stories, and taking action that matters.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- **Define** what GIS is in your own words  
- **Identify** real-world applications of GIS technology  
- **Explore** GIS careers and opportunities  
- **Connect** GIS to your own interests and community  

---

## ⏱️ 60-Second Definition Challenge

Set a timer for 1 minute.

**Prompt:** *“What is GIS?”*  
→ Jot, sketch, or voice-record your thoughts. It’s okay to guess — just activate your brain!

## 🧠 What is GIS?

GIS = **Geographic Information System**.

It's a digital system that helps us:
- **Collect** spatial data  
- **Store** and organize it  
- **Analyze** patterns and relationships  
- **Visualize** the insights using maps and tools  
- **Communicate** those stories to others

> 💡 *It turns invisible systems into visible stories.*

### Core Ingredients of GIS:
| Component | What It Means |
|----------|----------------|
| 🗺️ **Geographic Data** | Location-based info (coordinates, addresses, etc.) |
| 📊 **Attribute Data** | Details about what’s there (population, land use, etc.) |
| 💻 **Software Tools** | Programs like ArcGIS, QGIS, Felt |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **People** | *You*, using data to make change |

## 🧰 Interactive Toolbox

Pick 1–2 ways to explore what GIS is. Follow your curiosity:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎥 **Watch** | [“Why GIS Matters” by Dr. Joseph Kerski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d0QQCyO81I&t=2s) |
| 🎧 **Listen** | Audio reflection: *"If maps could talk, what would they say?"* (coming soon) |
| 📚 **Read** | [What is GIS? (Esri Overview)](https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview) |
| 🎮 **Play** | Explore a simple GIS map: *Starter Map – Explore Patterns* (link coming soon) |
| 🎨 **Sketch** | Draw a “map of your world” (your neighborhood, routine, or dreams) |
| 🧩 **Tactile** | Print and annotate a blank map: label areas you know and don’t know |

> 🛠 *Want to use headphones? Do it. Prefer to draw instead of write? Yes!*

## 🧪 Interactive Practice: Map Explorer Lab

### 🌍 Tool: *ArcGIS Online Starter Map* (link coming soon)

**Try this:**

1. Click into the map viewer  
2. Turn on 2–3 layers  
3. Zoom into your area or one that interests you  
4. Ask: *What do I notice? What questions come up?*

**Look For:**
- Any surprising patterns?  
- Who's included or excluded?  
- How might this map influence decisions?

🎯 *Optional Bonus:* Try making a simple map with labels and symbology

## 🌍 Real-World Uses of GIS

| Sector | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| 🏥 **Healthcare** | Map COVID trends, ambulance routes, health deserts |
| 🌱 **Environment** | Track deforestation, water pollution, fire risk |
| 🏙️ **Urban Planning** | Improve transit, housing access, or food systems |
| 🛒 **Business** | Choose locations, study customer patterns |
| 🧭 **Social Justice** | Map inequities in policing, parks, or public funding |

> “Maps don’t just reflect power — they can *challenge* it.”
